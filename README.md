# Solutions-to-Problems-in-Bayesian-Statistics
This repository contains my solutions to the assignments in the book: "A Studentâ€™s Guide to Bayesian Statistics" by Ben Lambert. I will update the repository with my solutions continuously.

Each chapter of the book has its corresponding folder in this repository. These solutions consist of Python code as well as pdfs.

##### Coal mining disasters in the UK - Gibbs Sampling
Using Gibbs sampling to estimate the point in time when legislative and societal changes caused a reduction in coal mining disasters in
the UK. The number of disasters per year pre and post legislations were modeled using Poisson Likelihoods: Possion(lambda_1), Possion(lambda_2) with Gamma priors. The point in time when the new legislations were enacted is called n.
